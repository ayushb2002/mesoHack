    "* How many times a word appears\n",
    "* Where each occurrence appears\n",

    "Another powerful feature of NLTK is its ability to quickly find `collocations` with simple function calls. Collocations are series of words that frequently appear together in a given text. In the State of the Union corpus, for example, you’d expect to find the words United and States appearing next to each other very often. Those two words appearing together is a collocation.\n",

The man turned out to be the head of the editorial department. Spielberg got a pass to the lot for the very next day and showed a very impressed Chuck Silvers four of his eight-millimeter films.
