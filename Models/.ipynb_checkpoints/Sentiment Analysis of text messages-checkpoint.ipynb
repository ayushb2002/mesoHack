    "* How many times a word appears\n",
    "* Where each occurrence appears\n",

    "Another powerful feature of NLTK is its ability to quickly find `collocations` with simple function calls. Collocations are series of words that frequently appear together in a given text. In the State of the Union corpus, for example, youâ€™d expect to find the words United and States appearing next to each other very often. Those two words appearing together is a collocation.\n",

The man turned out to be the head of the editorial department. Spielberg got a pass to the lot for the very next day and showed a very impressed Chuck Silvers four of his eight-millimeter films.
